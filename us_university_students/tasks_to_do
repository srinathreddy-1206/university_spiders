I need you to scrape the CURRENT STUDENT (not alumni) databases of the following twenty websites. We're looking for all students (undergrad and graduate), but we DO NOT want professors included.

We need each students' first name, last name, email, and any other information that you can provide. You can see the approx # of students at each school here (http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/#page:1_sort:0_direction:asc_search:_filter:All%20states)
